    color: #1b242f;
    margin-top: 13px;">ECN, which stands for <b>Electronic Communication Network </b>, really is the way of the future for the Foreign Exchange Markets. ECN can best be described as a bridge linking smaller market participants with tier-1 liquidity providers through a FOREX ECN Broker. 
An ECN broker benefits from commission fees per transaction. The higher trading volume the broker's clients generate, the higher the broker's profitability.</p>
